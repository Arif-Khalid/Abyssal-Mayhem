### Gamemodes
* Infinite Spawn:
  * Players will spawn with an assault rifle with infinite ammo to kill monsters that spawn in their own arenas. 
  * Each monster kill will spawn the same monster at the same location in their opponent’s arena.
  * Players will play by levels and the level will be declared completed when a quota for the number of monsters killed is reached.
  * There will be power ups and better equipment lying around the map and players may acquire them by roaming around.

* Snipe to win(In Development)
  * Players will spawn with an assault rifle with infinite ammo to kill monsters that spawn in their own arenas. 
  * Each kill entitles them to an orbital strike which can destroy a part of their opponent’s map grid. 
  * Better equipment and power ups can be obtained through roaming their own arenas to aid them in their battle for survival.

## How to play
This is a 2-player game, thus you would need a friend and both players would need to download steam and create an account in order to connect and play together using the steam networking API. Designate one player to be the host and one to be the client who will connect to the host. The host and client would also need to be friends on steam.
***
**Setup for host**
1. Download our current build here: [Latest build](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18KoYgdG_3FJLKV1s0028FOlBEPWYtt_j?usp=sharing)
2. After downloading the entire Abyssal Mayhem zip file, unzip the file to a local directory
3. Start the steam client on your device
4. Launch the Abyssal Mayhem executable from the extracted files from step 2
5. Enter Infinite Spawn using the play infinite spawn button and select your desired difficulty
6. Explore the map and kill monsters while waiting for your friend to join you
***
**Setup for client**
1. Follow the same steps 1-4 as the setup for host such that you are now in the main menu of Abyssal Mayhem
2. Find the host's steam account on your steam friends list and join game from there
